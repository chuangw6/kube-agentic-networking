                            A request's identity must be present in this list to match the rule.

                            Identities must be specified as SPIFFE-formatted URIs following the pattern:
                              spiffe://<trust_domain>/<workload-identifier>

                            While the exact workload identifier structure is implementation-specific,
                            implementations are encouraged to follow the convention of
                            `spiffe://<trust_domain>/ns/<namespace>/sa/<serviceaccount>`
                            when representing Kubernetes workload identities.

                            ServiceAccounts specifies a list of Kubernetes Service Accounts that are
                            matched by this rule. A request originating from a pod associated with
                            one of these Serviceaccounts will match the rule.

                            Values must be in one of the following formats:
                              - "<namespace>/<serviceaccount-name>": A specific Serviceaccount in a namespace.
                              - "<namespace>/*": All Serviceaccounts in the given namespace.
                              - "<serviceaccount-name>": a Serviceaccount in the same namespace as the policy.

                            Use of "*" alone (i.e., all Serviceaccounts in all namespaces) is not allowed.
                            To select all Serviceaccounts in the current namespace, use "<namespace>/*" explicitly.

                            Example:
                              - "default/bookstore" → Matches Serviceaccount "bookstore" in namespace "default"
                              - "payments/*" → Matches any Serviceaccount in namespace "payments"
                              - "frontend" → Matches "frontend" Serviceaccount in the same namespace as the policy

                            The ServiceAccounts listed here are expected to exist within the same
                            trust domain as the targeted workload, which in many environments means
                            the same Kubernetes cluster. Cross-cluster or cross-trust-domain access
                            should instead be expressed using the `Identities` field.
